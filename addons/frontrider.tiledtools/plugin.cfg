description="Tools to used Tiles as a level editor for Godot Games.

This is NOT a Tiled map loader for godot. This is a collection of tools that helps you import maps from Tiled at runtime, and prepare your game to use Tiled as an external level editor.

Contains:
- a node that loads tiled maps at runtime
- an editor plugin that converts the Godot tileset into a tiled tileset."
