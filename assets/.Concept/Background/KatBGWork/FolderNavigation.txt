-BG MockUps is an active file I save over many times. I feel most comfortable drafting and working in CPS!

-Files in this folder are files I'm currently using. I'll try to keep it cleaned up so you know exactly what I'm currently working on. 



> KatBGWork > ConceptSketching

-This a repository for old sketches, thumbails, color studies, etc. I'll prune it over time, but for now I'll hold onto things until we are finished with a particular zone.
