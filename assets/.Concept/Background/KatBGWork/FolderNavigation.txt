-BG MockUps is an active file I save over many times. I feel most comfortable drafting and working in CPS!

-Files in this folder are files I'm currently using. I'll try to keep it cleaned up so you know exactly what I'm currently working on. 



> KatBGWork > ConceptSketching

-This a repository for old sketches, thumbails, color studies, etc. I'll prune it over time, but for now I'll hold onto things until we are finished with a particular zone.



> KatBGWork > LaputaNotes

- I've started keeping notes in here that pertains to our weekly meetings! If there's another folder better suited for this, let me know and I'll migrate the content over there. Until then, I'm happy to keep them housed here.
