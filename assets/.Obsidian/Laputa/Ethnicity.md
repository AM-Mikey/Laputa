#concept 

[[Island of Laputa|Laputa]] is a melting pot of people from different places on the [[Surface]]. Each of these places has their own unspecified cultural makeup, loosely based on cultures on planet earth. Because of the divide between [[Humans and Beastfolk]], ethnicity is rarely an issue when it comes to interacting, although beasts and men from the same region will get along better. 

Language is not a barrier for culture, as all places on the Surface speak the same language, despite geographic differences.

The island of Laputa has developed it's own culture, distinct from surface culture. People from the Island may have a distaste for surface people and vice versa.
