#group #concept

The Resistance was a political movement rejecting [[King Davey]]'s rule and working to oust him as leader. The movement originated from the [[Night Parade]] of [[Capital City]], and, with assistance from [[Juniper]] and the group, spread to all of the other towns of [[Island of Laputa| Laputa]].

Once it was discovered that Colin was the illegitimate son of the [[Laputa's Former King|Old King]], a constituency within the Resistance promoted the plan to install him as Laputa's new [[Laputan Crown|King]].
