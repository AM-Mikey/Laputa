Proposed idea to explain why so many unrelated adults are dead preceding the events of Laputa. 

List of potentially affected characters:
	[[Parsley and Thyme]] (as a cover, possibly. they were killed by Rosemary.)
	[[Basil]]'s Parents? (or did they abandon him)
	[[Laputa's Former King]] and Queen of Laputa
	Parents of the [[Lost Boys]]
	[[Dogtown]]'s former priest
