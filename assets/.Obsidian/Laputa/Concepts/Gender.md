Like [[Ethnicity]], Gender plays less of a part on the [[Surface]] and on [[Island of Laputa|Laputa]] than it does in our own world. Both men and women are allowed to work the same jobs, and carry the same responsibilities, although some cultures believe one gender is better suited for a task than another.

There is also the concept of third or Neutral gender. Some characters in the game are this. This is not an identity but a biological rarity. It is generally accepted and respected by most individuals.

Homosexuality and Bisexuality are taboo, but not completely uncommon. People who are gay or bi are likely to hide their relationships in plain sight.

Transgender identities are generally unacceptable, so transgender characters feel the need to hide their secret or never transition. Medical transition is possible but is a difficult process.
