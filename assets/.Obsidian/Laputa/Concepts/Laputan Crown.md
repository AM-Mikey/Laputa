Far from a superficial title, the King of Laputa actually is an ancient position created by the original [[Laputans]]. The crown is usually passed down through first male descendant, but can be revoked by the Laputan guardians of the title.

A test or ritual involving the McGuffin needs to be performed to validate the title. 



- This may or may not give the King supernatural powers. Doing so would make the stakes of preventing Davey completing the ritual higher.
