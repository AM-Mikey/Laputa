Far from a superficial title, the King of Laputa actually is an ancient position created by the original [[Laputans]]. The crown is usually passed down through first male descendant, but can be revoked by the Laputan guardians of the title.

A test or ritual involving the McGuffin needs to be performed to validate the title. 



- This may or may not give the King supernatural powers. Doing so would make the stakes of preventing Davey completing the ritual higher.


The test might involve these steps:
- Getting the [[McGuffin]] and activating it
- Climbing the [[Tower of Babel]]
- Descending into the [[Heart of the Island]]
- Fighting, or transfering ownership from the [[Spirit of the Island]], becoming the new Spirit.

The thing about the king being passed down is made up, the real power of a new king's suitability is how many believe he is king. The power of the next spirit of the island may come from this alone.
