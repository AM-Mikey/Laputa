Davey knows something his father doesnt, That the mcguffin is the first part of the test, that it's a remote to cause the tower to rise out of the ground and for him to progress to the next part of the test. He may or may not know/suspect that the royal guards are the test coordinators.


Knowing that the Mcguffin will be transfered to him on the day of the throning ceremony, Davey likely holds onto this information for several years, and builds his corporation on the surface so that he can walk in unopposed.
