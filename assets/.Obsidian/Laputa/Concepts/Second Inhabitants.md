In between the era of [[Laputans]] and [[Colonists]] on [[Island of Laputa|Laputa]], there was another group that came to laputa, and waged war over the island. These inhabitants had already developed a technological industry similar to the one occuring on the surface during the events of the game. It was during the time of these inhabitants that [[Kiwi and Mother]] were used, and the [[Ravine]] opened up.

It's likely that these Inhabitants are humans or beastfolk or the both of them. It seems at some point Laputa was fought over in a war between empires. After this point their society collapsed on the surface and they retreated from the island. Humans and Beastfolk have had to build up to the level that these people were previously at, though they've retained some knowledge like Laputa's existence. These would be "Third Inhabitants" needed to develop the technology to reach the island once again. 

The second inhabitants may have been human or beastfolk, and the debate about this may still be raging on the surface to this day.

The second seed of life fell when the second inhabitants were on the brink of extinction.
