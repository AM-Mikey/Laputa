Religion is nondescript in the game, it's assumed that there is one major religion practiced on the island that is similar to Catholicism, although others are likely practiced due to Laputa's [[Ethnicity|cultural]] makeup.

In [[Dogtown]], there is a church that is being led by a nun, after the death of the former priest. Once Davey takes over the town, he installs a puppet priest known as Father Michael, which causes Nun to step down from her position.
