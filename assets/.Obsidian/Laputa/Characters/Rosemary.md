Deceased sibling of [[Sage]] and child of [[Parsley and Thyme]]. Later became fused with the [[Spirit of the Island|Spirit of Laputa]] and took on the identity: [[Scrum]].

Rose is completely filled with hatred and jealousy, and these parts live on in scrum. What also lives on in scrum is the desire to end their own life.

It's likely in Sage's backstory that Rose murdered their parents. Rose was unable to murder Sage as well, because of the small bond they shared as siblings. Rose left, and then went to the Ravine to kill themselves. Meanwhile Sage woke up, and either burned or woke up to an already burning house. Sage left in her father's [[Jalopy]]
