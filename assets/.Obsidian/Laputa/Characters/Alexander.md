One of the King's Bodyguards alongside [[Emily]] and right hand man to [[King Davey]]. He is a [[Laputans|Laputan]].

#### Personality
Alexander is a theatrical person, and loves gossip and drama. He prefers to play with the people he fights with, and often tries to get under the skin of his allies. Despite this, he is steadfast in his loyalty to the king, who trusts him to discuss important matters and keep secrets. Alexander seemingly takes a liking to [[Juniper]], in a way that suggests he finds his efforts to overthrow Davey amusing. He often refers to Juniper as "bunny", but if this is meant to be demeaning or cute is unclear.

Although normally jovial, when an enemy outsmarts him, he will break into a fit of mad laughter, and reveal his more hateful, savage side.

#### Powers
Alexander possesses the powers of teleportation, levitation and telekinesis, being able to move large objects with the snap of his fingers. It's possible that all these powers are just different forms of telekinesis.

#### After Defeat
Near the end of the game, after being defeated by Juniper and sensing the inevitable defeat of King Davey, he reveals to the protagonist everything he knows about the crown title and the history of the Laputans. He suggests that by defeating Davey, Juniper could become the new King.
