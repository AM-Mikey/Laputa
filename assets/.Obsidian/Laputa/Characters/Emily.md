Emily is one of the bodyguards assigned to protect [[King Davey]]. She is a [[Laputans|Laputan]], like [[Alexander]]. She is mostly silent and always seems to have pissed-off expression. She has a strong sense of justice and will fight until death to protect the [[Laputan Crown|King]].

#### Personality
Emily's history is marred in tragedy, the horrors she's seen having shaped the person she became. She has a menacing aura and a cold stare that can shoot down anyone in the room. Emily never removes her armor, and is always prepared to fight for her life. Originally dedicating herself as a protector of the weak, she seems to have forgotten this in her many years of protecting the future king Davey. While she remains loyal, secretly, she holds a deep antipathy for David.
