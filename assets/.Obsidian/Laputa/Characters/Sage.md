Older Sister to [[Basil]] and deuteragonist in Laputa.

##### Relationship with Rose


##### Teenage Years
Back when Sage was a boy, she had shoulder length brown hair that came to a curl on both ends. She wore a white long sleeve shirt and had a cold, narrow stare.

##### Death
After the death of her parents, she had to soon after endure Rose's suicide as well. It's possible that she may not know Rose's fate.

##### Transition
Sometime after the death of her family, Sage transitioned to a woman, starting a new life in Dogtown, out of Parsley's old shop.

##### Personality
Sage is a friendly and patient figure who enjoys teasing [[Juniper]] and Basil. She has an attitude of nonchalance, but hides the things that matter to her and hurt her the most. It's possible that she develops romantic feelings for Juniper throughout the story, but this is left ambiguous. 

- If Sage needs to be there for the Heart of the Island, she's a little too tall and awkward to have her running and gunning. Consider putting her in a mech/vehicle
