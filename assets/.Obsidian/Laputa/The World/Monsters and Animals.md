Owing to being a floating, disconnected, landmass, Laputa's fauna has evolved differently from the surface world. Strange, hostile creatures known as monsters inhabit every corner of the island, and peaceful creatures called animals exist in the wild, as well as among both people and monsters. 

#### Monsters
Creatures that attack on sight are considered monsters. All of them are native to the Island. Because of their overwhelming presence, Laputa developed a market for firearms, and many gunsmiths and factories (such as [[LZH Firearms Co.]]) turned a profit off of selling guns. 

The hunting of monsters for sport is encouraged by the [[Old Guard]], and populations near urban areas are regularly culled. Monsters generally fall into three categories, **Organic**, **Inorganic**, and **Mixed Type**. All monsters yield Experience upon their deaths. It's not clear weather the surface has monsters.

	Organic: Flash and blood creatures
	
	Inorganic: Made of materials such as stone and wood. They contain no internal organs, and when destroyed, their components fall apart, sometimes yielding useful resources.

	Mixed Type: Organic creatures with or carrying inorganic parts. It's not clear where these components come from.

#### Animals
Laputa has both native animals, and ones imported by the Colonists. In addition to those, varieties of bird flock to the island for shelter.

#### As Food
Most domestic animals on Laputa are raised for food production, some species such as dogs and cats are used for their utilities in hunting and protecting livestock. While monsters are often hunted for sport, some hunters do consume Organic types (given some difficulty to mask the taste)

#### In relation to Beastfolk
A common suggestion, originally seriously discussed, which then fell out of popularity is the theory that the ancestors of beastfolk are the animals they resemble. This comparison is easy to make and harder to disprove. People who subscribe to this theory either see beastfolk evolving from animals independently as a result of interbreeding with humans. In modern times, the theory is considered debunked, as it is now known that Beastfolk are members of a single species with many varieties. Despite this, academics on the surface (by whom Davey was tought) have recently revived the theory to justify Anti-Human discrimination.

It is considered extremely offensive to suggest this theory to a beastfolk, and they are often discriminatorily called "animals". It is not as offensive to call a beastfolk by the animal the resemble, i.e: "cat", though this too can be used derogatorily. 

#### Birds
Bird species play a particularly important role in ancient Laputan culture, as they are the only species that can migrate between the island and the surface world. Because of this, they're seen as something like messengers who can transcend and carry messages between this world and the next.
