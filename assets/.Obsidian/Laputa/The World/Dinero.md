Money on the island of Laputa is marked in Δ Dinero, different quantities of gold.

Gold is the primary export of Laputa, having been extracted in raids of massive treasure hoards. Near the tail end of the Golden Age, gold was mined directly from deposits near the surface. Third Era mining tunnels built off of the existing tunnels from the First and Second Eras.

Laputan Monsters have some innate lust for gold, and consume it. It's unknown why or what nutrients they extract, but their bodies transform it into the well known "spikeball" format that's commonly traded. During the lawless age of Laputa, hunting monsters for spikeball gold is the most viable way to extract the resource.

Dinero is traded in modern coin format, using various surface mints, or in spikeball form. Money exchangers exist to weigh gold and note it's purity for exchange in big cities.

Under occupation, Davey may try to institute his own currency, carrying his face. Dinero becomes a more black-market currency.
