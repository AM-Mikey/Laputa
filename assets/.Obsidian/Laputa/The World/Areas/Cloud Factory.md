#place 

An old abandoned weapons and ammunition factory run by [[LZH Firearms Co.]] years ago. At some point it was painted with a blue sky and cloud motif to disguise it's presence. After becoming disused for a number of years, [[Dogtown]] inhabitants began dubbing it "The Cloud Factory" because of it's appearance.

[[Basil]] tasks [[Juniper]] with reaching the top of the factory, to fix a radio transmitter on the roof. It's here that he fights the [[Treasure Hunter]].

In the early part of the game, this is where the [[Zephyr]] initially lands.
