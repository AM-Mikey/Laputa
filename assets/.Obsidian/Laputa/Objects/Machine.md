The machine is a recording device brought by [[King Davey|Davey]] from the surface to categorize and sort the [[Colonists|Laputan Colonists]]. It scans the subject and records all vital information about them, taking their picture and producing an ID Card.

Inspired by the English man who introduced the country to the Edison roll.
