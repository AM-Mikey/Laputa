The opening stage of the game. The [[McGuffin]] is being transferred to the [[Capital City]] but is ambushed near [[Dogtown]], by the [[Sky Pirates]]. This however, is just a distraction, as the real work stealing the McGuffin is being done by [[Juniper]], who was stowed away in a crate in the caboose at the start of the game.


This train goes around to most places on the island, and keeps the disparate towns connected. During [[King Davey|Davey]]'s occupation, the trains are strictly regulated, with ID's being checked for criminals. Once the revolution kicks off, we can return to previous towns, liberating them and opening up their respective train stations.

List of Train Stations:
	[[Dogtown]]
	[[Winter Town]]
	[[Capital City]]
	[[Desert Town]]
