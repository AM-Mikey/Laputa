It's likely Laputans buried their dead via sky burial. Laputan culture puts emphasis on birds as the link between surface and island fauna. They may have seen them as literal carriers taking the bodies to the afterlife.

During the first Era, the propagation of trees was manually carried out to prevent wind erosion on the surface of the island. Starting from the inside-out, they grew forests in areas that could sustain them. In the years since, this tree cover has retreated from the edges of the island, where colonists cleared land for farming.

The Island once had prevalent gold deposits, so it was often used as a decorative and religious material
