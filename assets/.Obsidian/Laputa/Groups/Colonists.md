The colonists are the third inhabitants of the Island Laputa. They're population has been reduced to only a fraction of what it was during the Golden Age. Colonists live without easy access to surface goods because of the 7-year window. They live in small communities that are mostly lawless, aside from the Old Guard, whom are more invested in preserving their own brotherhood.
