This is the company [[King Davey|Davey]] ran during his time on the surface, under the supervision of [[Alexander]] and [[Emily]]. The corp. manufactures everything and funds it's own private military. Once Davey takes control of Laputa, he phases out the [[Old Guard]] makes the Corp. the de-facto military presence on the island.

It's likely Davey founded this after he discovered his [[Davey's Secret Knowledge|Secret Knowledge]], or added it's military branch after finding this out.
