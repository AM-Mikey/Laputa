- bug: erase on single tile layer doesnt work

--- tileset ---

- disallow swap with empty
- warn swap with different layer
- add tile swap
- fix one pixel off tile cursor

--- level ---

- move old levels

--- editor ---
-consider adding ability to edit tileset not on current level
-switch cursor to brush on start
-dont require enter on text input to apply, or make it more obvious

--- animated tileset ---
-make sure to account for remapping
-new animation node per tileset, autoload it in on level
sometimes erased tiles will return and be animated on certain frames (resolves on reload)

--- ui --- 
clean up ui asset files


--- background ---
having a background smaller than camera size will reset to another camera size (square? taking horz?)


--- autotile ---
autotile in it's own parent script
custom data for autotile group: i.e. dirt
custom data for autotile position
check if tile adjascent in same group
add graphics to denote layer boundaries in tileset

for example: if no dirt beneath this tile, then set this tile to one of a few "bottom" tiles

--- enemy ---
delete all enemy button

--- player ---
fix ssp detection on angles
disable crouch on command
edge animation on idle with long toe-hang
capsule collision when not near edge?
blend frames for direction, crouch changes


--- background for train ---
long panoramic background that tiles horizontally and moves 
closer scaled layers will move more from train movement

--- levels ---
reimplement level notes
reimplement level music

--- editor ---
clean up all setup and exit code
editor calls setup_level on change level, but does not exit or get removed
stop adding TileMapCursor every time editor is opened
pressing x somehow counts as clicking handles on resizable boxes?

---enemy ---
update waypoint based enemies

--- triggers --- 
replace triggervisuals
prepare text-based triggers to work with new dialog nodes

--- propertybutton ---
clean up signals and names
force update on edit instead of enter

---themes---
clean up unused themes

---doors---
remove spawns layer from levels if not neccesary

--- player ---
migrate disabled code to can_input
clean up enemy, npc, misc disable code
death on leave level via bottom
X				terminal velocity
add state for starting level(?)
default state is inspect?? why

--- level ---
fix level preview on main menu and update non-skip menu code
fix save/load
fix playerless cutscene levels

first time setup without save data crashes the game on world -> read level from temp()

-- background ---

we have to save as resource to save our changes to bk!!
tile map background enum changes
animated bk not working in editor
back_tile_mode repeat not long enough for ultrawide
add layer horizontal offsets (for if we want the layer to start earlier because it doesnt tile)

---triggers---
spawn preview
stop adding more triggers on level reload
editor select trigger color fix
enable shooting on ladders
force drop off ladders on damage
drop through semisolid platform if there is a ladder
door transition glitches if done too fast

---Effect---
bubble sfx
first time load wipe in(?)
level up/down graphics
out of ammo animation
explosion effect
differentiate player and enemy damage numbers


---INSPECTOR---
clean up button order on background
background button for loading is fucked. try making it up to spec with string etc


---enemy---
update any enemy that's x or y size is 16px to be smaller to fit through gaps
change enemy collision shapes on animate?
enemy grab region is crazy small on toggler
animate climber and change sprite based on level


---bullet---
clarify SSP bullet bounce behavior

--gun--
restore ammo on level up
blunderbuss buckshot sprites/particles and icon
guns with stocks need proper sprite support.
	this would require an arm layer or something specific

--editor---x
reload wastes.tscn


--text--
animation finished (use characters, cent, pound, euro, circle with x,
unable to run commands at end of line
reimplement text choices
draw juniper responce choice
topic system
flavor text 
signs
merge npc and sign dialog
text slide up transition in
dialog box shake effect

---shop---
cash register sound on purchase


---trigger

trigger sizes change on signs on load
sign spawns weird

---inspector
accept line on deselect
control c doesnt work?
doesnt clear if selected is the same type (two doors)
property order is alphabetical on load?

---juniper---
satisfying combos(?)
fix fake jump after falling off platform (sound but no movement)
not actually entering knockback state when knockback. investigate this
bonking on angled ceilings gives us velocity, only while stationary. investigate if this is good or not
