-fix shoot down on ssp (the ssp detection is bad, we need like a raycast from the muzzle)
-migrate disabled code to can_input (consider not using disabled anymore)
-juniper's default state is inspect? check if this causes issues
-for edge and edge_turn animations, juniper's collisionshapes are innacurate. consider at least updating his hurtbox

	-flash max on max xp pickup
	-make transparency use canvasgroup, so its all transparent at once
	-weaponwheel fixes
	-make hp and xp bar do a fill up animation on game or level start (to be consistant with recharge bar)
