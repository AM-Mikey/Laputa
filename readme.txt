Return to Laputa

The Island of Laputa
The floating island of Laputa has existed for as long as humanity can remember. Only recently has the combined power of new technology and the determination of both men and beast allowed them to travel to it.
The 7-year cycle
The biggest obstacle in travel to Laputa is it’s inaccessibility. Most of the time the island is lost behind a thick layer of clouds. For a few weeks every seven years, the island reveals itself from behind them, before vanishing yet again.
The cycles of the island’s appearance are well documented, and can be predicted with relative accuracy. Where Laputa will show up is another question entirely, as the island appears to move slowly with the wind.
Close to the Heart
At the center of the island is a dense forest known as “The Heart” Many explorers have gone in, never to be seen again. It’s rumored that at the core of this forest is whatever keeps the island afloat, or temples filled with boundless treasure.

Plundered Goods
Early exploration and settlement of Laputa was spurred on by the promise of vast wealth to be acquired there. During the first expedition, treasure-seekers found storehouses full of gold and silver, as well as fine goods and other artifacts found within the island’s ancient structures.
It was later found out that the island itself is rich with veins of ore and mineral, and so much of Laputa’s export has been of these precious resources.
